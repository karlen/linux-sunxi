* Pin-controller driver for the Marvell Berlin SoCs

The pins controlled by the Marvell Berlin controller are organized in groups.
Configuration is done by group, so no actual pin information is needed.

Be aware the Marvell Berlin datasheets use the keyword 'mode' for what is called
a 'function' in the pin-controller subsystem.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of:
	"marvell,berlin2-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2-sysmgr-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2cd-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2cd-sysmgr-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2q-soc-pinctrl",
	"marvell,berlin2q-sysmgr-pinctrl"
- reg: registers physical address and length of the pin controller.

Please refer to pinctrl-bindings.txt in this directory for details of the
common pin-controller bindings used by client devices.

A pin-controller node should contain subnodes representing the pin group
configurations, one per function. Each subnode has the group name and the muxing
function used.

Required subnode-properties:
- marvell,groups: a list of strings describing the group names.
- marvell,function: a string describing the function used to mux the groups.

Example:

sm_pinctrl: pin-controller@0 {
	compatible = "marvell,berlin2q-sysmgr-pinctrl";
	reg = <0xfc0000 0x44>;

	uart0_pmux: uart0-pmux {
		marvell,groups = "GSM12", "GSM13";
		marvell,function = "uart0";
	};
}

&uart0 {
	pinctrl-0 = <&uart0_pmux>;
	pinctrl-names = "default";
};
